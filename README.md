A library for working with hidden Markov processes. This is a literate
program, and as such the code should be considered the primary source
of documentation. Start [here][gh-hmm], or see [here][gh-clinic] for a
usage example.

If you want to learn about Markov models, start by reading: [Lawrence R.
Rabiner, _A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in
Speech Recognition_, Proceedings of the IEEE 77 (1989): 257-286][rabiner]. If
you know of any better introductions (having read the above article) please
let the authors know!
